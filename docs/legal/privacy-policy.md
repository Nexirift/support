# Privacy Policy

!!! info "Last Updated: 07 January 2026"

This Privacy Policy explains how Nexirift (the "Service") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our federated social network instance.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

### Federated Data

- Public posts and profile information shared across the Fediverse

## How We Use Information

### Service Operation

- Provide and maintain the social networking service
- Enable federation with other Fediverse instances
- Authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access
- Display your content according to your privacy settings

### Communication

- Send essential service notifications
- Respond to support requests and legal inquiries
- Notify about policy changes or service updates

### Security and Moderation

- Detect and prevent spam, abuse, and security threats
- Enforce our Terms of Service and Server Rules
- Maintain logs for security and debugging purposes

### Automated Moderation (NEXA)

We employ an automated moderation system called **NEXA** ([learn more](https://code.nexirift.com/Nexirift/nexa)) to help maintain a safe and welcoming environment. NEXA runs exclusively on our servers and provides the following protections:

- **Virus detection** with ClamAV
- **Spam and scam detection** using machine learning classifiers
- **Phishing detection**
- **NSFW content detection** with the nsfwjs model

All moderation processes are performed locally, no user data is shared with third parties for moderation purposes. Your data is **never** used to train moderation models, ensuring your privacy is protected.

## Data Protection

### Security Measures

- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS)
- Secure password storage using industry-standard hashing
- Regular security updates and monitoring
- Limited access to personal data by administrators

### Data Retention

- Account data retained while your account is active
- Deleted accounts: data removed from our servers within 30 days
- Security logs retained for up to 12 months
- Backup data may persist for up to 90 days after deletion

### Federation Implications

Once public (or shared private - by you) content is federated, it may be stored or redistributed by other Fediverse servers beyond our control. Deleting or modifying your content on our instance does not guarantee removal from other servers. Please consider this before sharing publicly or with specific users, as we cannot enforce deletion or privacy on remote instances.

## Your Rights

### Access and Control

- View and export your data through account settings
- Delete your account and associated data at any time
- Migrate to another Fediverse instance
- Control privacy settings for your content

### Data Portability

- Export your posts, media, and follower lists
- Import data when migrating from other instances
- Account migration assistance available upon request

## Third-Party Services

### Federation

Your public data is shared with other Fediverse instances according to ActivityPub protocol standards. We cannot control how other instances handle your public data.

### Cloudflare Insights

Other than the usage of Cloudflare Insights for speed and security metrics, we do not use any third-party analytics, mainstream advertising networks, or tracking services. Errors may be tracked and stored on-site.

## Legal Basis (Australian Privacy Principles)

We process your personal information based on:

- Legitimate interests in providing the service
- Consent for optional features and communications
- Legal obligations for security and law enforcement requests
