### Can I follow users from other instances?

Yes! You can follow and interact with users from other Sharkey instances and compatible platforms like Pleroma, PeerTube, and others.

### Why can't I see some posts from other instances?

Some instances may be blocked or limited due to moderation policies. Content may also be filtered based on your personal settings.

## Community Questions

### How do I report problematic content?

Use the built-in report feature (three dots menu on any post) or email [moderation@nexirift.com](mailto:moderation@nexirift.com).

### What are content warnings?

Content warnings (CW) are a way to hide potentially sensitive content behind a warning label. Users can choose whether to view the content.

## Account Questions

### Can I change my username?

Usernames cannot be changed on Sharkey. If you need a different username, you'll need to create a new account and migrate your followers.

### How do I verify my identity?

Sharkey uses link verification rather than centralized verification. Add links to your other profiles in your bio, and they'll show as verified if you add the proper rel="me" tag.

Although, our instance does provide individual verification for eligible users, but applications are not currently available.

### What if I forget my password?

Use the password reset feature on the login page. You'll receive an email with instructions to reset your password.
