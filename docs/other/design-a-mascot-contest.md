To celebrate the official launch of Nexirift, the staff team is excited to announce a sitewide contest to design Nexirift's official mascot! The winning artwork will be featured across the platform as the face of Nexirift.

## Rules

- Any species is welcome: humans, furries, aliens, or anything you can imagine! Have fun and be creative.
- All submissions must be original work. AI-generated images are not allowed and may result in disciplinary action.
- Using art bases is permitted, provided you credit the original artist.
- All artwork must be entirely Safe For Work.
- Both 2D and 3D artwork are accepted.

## Rewards

The winner will receive:

- A "Verified Artist" badge, granted automatically—no application or requirements needed.
    - Learn more about the [Verified Artist program](../programs/verified-artists.md).
    - See details in the ["Other" roles section](../roles.md#other).
- Featured recognition across Nexirift’s platform and social media.
- The opportunity to have your artwork showcased as Nexirift’s official mascot.

## Submissions

Submissions must be sent via direct messages (the beta Chat feature) to [@Contests](https://nexirift.com/@Contests) before the 2nd of February.

If you wish to remain anonymous (for some reason), make sure you include that in your submission message, as we will be showing usernames when voting otherwise.

## Terms

### For Contestants

- By submitting your artwork, you grant Nexirift a temporary, revocable license to use and display your submission for contest-related purposes.
    - This license expires automatically 30 days after the contest concludes.
    - You may revoke this license at any time by contacting [@Contests](https://nexirift.com/@Contests) or [contests@nexirift.com](mailto:contests@nexirift.com).
- Adding a watermark to your submission is highly recommended. Ensure it is not overly intrusive, but it may cover the entire artwork if you prefer.

### For Winners

- All terms for contestants also apply to winners.
- By winning, you grant Nexirift a permanent license to use and display your artwork on Nexirift’s platform and social media.
    - This license can be revoked by either party at any time, for any reason. If you wish to revoke the license, you must give Nexirift at least 60 days’ notice to allow for content removal and to arrange a replacement contest.
- Winners are required to provide the original source files for their artwork. You may:
    - Include a non-intrusive watermark on the image.
    - Flatten the image to prevent editing or tampering.
- Winners must submit a vector version of their artwork (.svg) with a minimum dimension of approximatively 512 pixels (1024 pixels preferred).
    - We would like an image that big so we can have a high quality version that can be scaled down across our assets when needed.
- If you used an art base, you must credit the original base artist beneath your own watermark (if present).
