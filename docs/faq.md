### Can I migrate my account to and from this instance?

Yes, you can migrate to or from Nexirift using standard Sharkey migration tools. This allows you to move your followers and following list to another instance.

### How do I view Twitter accounts and posts?

Search for `@account_name@bird.makeup` (replace `account_name` with the account name) to view the tweets (it will only show new tweets).

### How can I view Bluesky accounts and posts?

Please follow the instructions [here](https://fed.brid.gy/). This is opt-in so you might not be able to view some accounts.

### How can I view Threads accounts and posts?

This is opt-in on the Threads side by the users. After it is enabled, just search for `@account_name@threads.net` (it might threads.com - replace `account_name` with the account name) to view the posts.

## Technical Questions

### What software does Nexirift use?

Nexirift runs on Pulsar, a fork of Sharkey which is a fork of Misskey. It is an open-source social networking software that's part of the ActivityPub federation protocol.

See [here](https://docs.joinsharkey.org/docs/comparison/misskey) for more information.

### What data do you collect?

See our [Privacy Policy](legal/privacy-policy.md) for complete details about data collection and usage.

### How do I delete my account?

You can delete your account through your account settings. All data will be removed from our servers within 30 days.

### What happens to my data when I delete my account?

We remove all your data from our servers within 30 days, but cannot control copies that may exist on other federated instances where your content was shared.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, Sharkey provides data export functionality. You can download an archive of your posts, media, followers, and other account data.

### I can't view profiles on a different instance. Why?

Our instance has a blocklist of instances that misbehave or are not compliant with our rules. For transparency purposes, we provide a list of blocked instances [here](blocked-instances.md).

### Do you have an app? How can I install it?

Not really. But, you can find Misskey (preferred) or Mastodon clients on the app stores if you wish, see [here](https://misskey-hub.net/en/docs/for-users/resources/apps).

However, we would prefer if you just installed the progressive web app since that will have all of the features, see [here](https://misskey-hub.net/en/docs/for-users/stepped-guides/how-to-use-pwa).

### I have found an issue! How can I report it?

Please report issues by messaging [@Support](https://nexirift.com/@Support), emailing [support@nexirift.com](mailto:support@nexirift.com), looking on the [@Nexirift](https://nexirift.com/@Nexirift) account for the latest feedback post, or creating an issue on [code.nexirift.com](https://code.nexirift.com/Nexirift/pulsar/issues/new) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nexirift/pulsar/issues/new).

## Federation Questions

### Can I follow users from other instances?

Yes! You can follow and interact with users from other Sharkey instances and compatible platforms like Pleroma, PeerTube, and others.

### Why can't I see some posts from other instances?

Some instances may be blocked or limited due to moderation policies. Content may also be filtered based on your personal settings.

## Community Questions

### How do I report problematic content?

Use the built-in report feature (three dots menu on any post) or email [reports@nexirift.com](mailto:reports@nexirift.com).

### What are content warnings?

Content warnings (CW) are a way to hide potentially sensitive content behind a warning label. Users can choose whether to view the content.

### Can I appeal moderation decisions?

Yes, you can appeal moderation decisions by contacting [appeals@nexirift.com](mailto:appeals@nexirift.com) within 30 days of the action.

### How do I block or mute someone?

You can block or mute users through their profile page or by using the three dots menu on their posts. Blocking prevents all interaction, while muting hides their posts from your timeline.

## Account Questions

### Can I change my username?

Usernames cannot be changed on Sharkey. If you need a different username, you'll need to create a new account and migrate your followers.

### How do I verify my identity?

Sharkey supports link verification through the rel="me" standard. Add links to your other profiles in your bio with the proper `rel="me"` attribute, and they'll display as verified.

Our instance also offers individual verification for eligible users, though applications are not currently open.

### What if I forget my password?

Use the password reset feature on the login page. You'll receive an email with instructions to reset your password.

### Can moderators see my email?

No. A feature was added into Pulsar prior to the announcement launch that hides the emails from non-administrators. There is currently only one administrator which is the maintainer of the instance.

### Can I share my account with others?

Yes you can. Although, please refrain from sharing the account login details. Under the Security settings of your account, you can choose to "Share access".
